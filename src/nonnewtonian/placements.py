"""Parse textbook-placement lines into structured placements.

A placement line is one line under ``# Textbook``::

    Knight, Physics for Scientists and Engineers: A Strategic Approach
    with Modern Physics, 3rd Edition, Chapter 32, section 2

The 65 real lines in the corpus use at least seven grammars (audited
2026-07-07): lowercase ``chapter``, parenthetical chapter titles
(``Chapter 30 (Nuclear Physics)``), multi-sections (``Sections 1 & 5``),
bare topic tails (``Chapter 27, Nuclear Fission``), and shorthand
textbook names (``Knight, 2nd edition``) that the original pipeline's
exact-prefix matcher silently dropped — six real placements lost.

Contract here: NOTHING is dropped and nothing raises on real data.  The
verbatim line is always kept; an unrecognized textbook yields
``textbook_key=None`` plus a flag; unparseable tails become labels.

#: means College Physics 2nd Ed per the original author's code comment,
