"""Load and validate textbook table-of-contents CSVs.

The canonical format is the one IntroductoryPhysics used since 2016::

    Chapter,Section,Topics
    1,,"Motion, Velocity, Acceleration"
    2,,"1D Kinematics"

Validation exists because of a real, silent failure: the original
MandI4thEdition.csv has a stray doubled quote terminating every Topics
field, which makes csv fold 23 chapter lines into 13 mangled records —
every even-numbered chapter disappears into the previous row's Topics,
with no error raised.  The old pipeline would have published that.
``load_toc`` rejects exactly this class loudly; ``repair_doubled_quotes``
fixes the known seed file.
